# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 12, 2018 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with canvas, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
